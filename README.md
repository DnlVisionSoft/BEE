# BEE
Biometric Encription Environment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Traditional cryptosystems are based on the possession of secret keys that can be stolen or shared by non legitimate users. On the other hand, binding the real identity of a system user to what he is instead of something he knows or possesses is the main desirable property of biometric systems. Biometric Crypto-Systems (or BCSs) are designed to bind a cryptographic key with a biometric template to ensure that only a legitimate user can access to encrypted data.
